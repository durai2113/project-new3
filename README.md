Overview of my project:

The code is a simple implementation of an attendance and payroll management system using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only. The system allows users to input employee name, attendance date, and hours worked through a form. Upon submission, the data is displayed in a list format below the form.
The code is written in three separate files: an HTML file, a CSS file, and a JavaScript file. The HTML file contains the structure of the webpage, including the form and the list for displaying attendance data. The CSS file styles the webpage, making it visually appealing and easy to use. The JavaScript file handles the functionality of the webpage, such as form submission and data display.
The system is designed to be simple and easy to use, making it an ideal solution for small businesses or organizations that do not require a complex attendance and payroll management system. However, it can be further customized and expanded to meet more specific needs.
Overall, the code is a good starting point for anyone looking to build a basic attendance and payroll management system using only front-end technologies.
